Wiki Trace Example from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling
(see trace.pdf for traces worked out by hand)

trace.1 contains a trace of task FOO using EDF scheduling.  It is
the example trace from the wiki page on EDF schedulings using
maxConcurrentTasks = 1.

trace.2 contains a trace of task FOO using EDF scheduling.  It is
the example trace from the wiki page on EDF schedulings using
maxConcurrentTasks = 2.

trace.3 contains a trace of task FOO using RM scheduling.  It is
the example trace from the wiki page on EDF schedulings using
maxConcurrentTasks = 1.

To reproduce these traces,
   - uncomment the print statements in Tosf::Executive/SCHEDULER.pm
   - in main.pl, modify the variables $schedulingAlgorithm and $maxConcurrentTasks
