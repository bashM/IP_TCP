See Csci355 Lab9.
Note, to stay true to the Lab9 specification, CONN (controller) is
implemented as a Moor machine. The output is queued for later display.

Output queuing is not necessary since old output data that has not been
displayed is of no use. It is used  in this example to demonstrate
the model used in Inet.
