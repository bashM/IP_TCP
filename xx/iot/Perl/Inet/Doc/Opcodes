Ethernet
========
Opcode = 0

Input: Generic packet containing an Ip packet as payload.
Action/
Output: Add the IP packet to an Ethernet packet and write
        to DEV ADT.

Opcode = 1

Input:  Generic Packet with read-from-device message as payload.
Action/
Output: Read Ethernet packet from DEV ADT.  
        Add the Ethernet packet to a Generic packet and advance
        the packet to its next handler (ETHERNET Opcode == 2).

Opcode = 2 

Input:  Generic packet containing an Ethernet packet as payload.
Action/
Output: If Ethernet packet is for localhost then
           Extract payload packet from the Ethernet packet.  
           Add payload packet to a Generic packet and 
           advance the packet to its next handler
        else
           drop the Ethernet packet.

Ip
== 
Opcode = 0 

Input:  Generic packet containing an Ip packet as payload.
Action: Route IP packet.
        if 
Output: Generic packet containing an Ip packet as payload
Action: Route the Ip packet and advance the packet to the 
        next packet handler.

Opcode = 1 INSERT_ICMP_DATAGRAM_INTO_IP_DATAGRAM-ROUTE

Input:  Generic packet containing an Icmp packet as payload.
Output: Generic packet containing an Ip packet as payload.
Action: Create an Ip packet, add Ip addresses and Icmp packet as payload.
        Add Ip packet as payload to Generic packet and advance the packet
        to the next packet handler.

Opcode = 2 READ_IP_FRAME_FROM_DEV-DEMUX

Input:  Generic Packet with read-from-device message as payload.
Output: Generic Packet.
Action: Read IP packet from DEV ADT.  
        Insert into Generic packet and advance the packet 
        to the next handler.

Icmp
====
Opcode = 0 ICMP_DATAGRAM-ADVANCE_TO_IP 

Input:  Generic packet containing  message as payload.
Output: Generic packet containing an Icmp packet as payload.
Action: Based on the Generic packet's payload message, create an
        echo-request, echo-reply or time-exceeded Icmp packet.  Add Icmp
        packet as payload to a Generic packet and advance the packet
        to Ip.

Opcode = 1 ICMP_DATAGRAM-DEMUX

Input:  Generic packet containing an Icmp packet as payload.
Output: Generic Packet.
Action: De-multiplex Icmp packet to determine the packet's next handler.
        Add appropriate payload to a Generic packet and advance the
        packet to the next packet handler.

Ping
====
Opcode = 0 PING_REQUEST-ADVANCE_TO_ICMP

Input:  Generic packet containing a ping-request message as payload.
Output: Generic packet containing an Icmp packet construction-request
        message as payload.
Action: Add construction-request message as payload to a Generic 
        packet and advance the packet to Icmp.

Opcode = 1 PING_REPLY-WRITE_TO_DEV

Input:  Generic packet containing a ping-reply message as payload.
Output: A formatted ping-reply string. 
Action: Write the formatted string to DEV ADT.

Pingd

Input:  Generic packet containing a ping-reply message as payload.
Output: Generic packet containing an  Icmp packet construction-request
        message as payload.
Action: Advance Generic packet to Icmp.
Action: Add construction-request message as payload to a Generic 
        packet and advance the packet to Icmp.
