Reaction Monitoring System
==========================

React is a reaction monitoring system.  It is a centralized system
similar to CentralizedTL.  The system consists of  three status lights
(green light, amber light and red light) and one "clicable" input X.

X is displayed as a "clicable" button.  It is considered OFF (logic value
0) when it has a white background and ON (logic value 1) when it has a
black background.  The status lights can be either ON (illuminated)
or OFF.

Initially, the amber light and the green light are OFF and the red light
is ON.  After 5 seconds and once X is "clicked" ON, the red light is
turned OFF and the amber light is turned ON. After a further delay of
10 seconds, the amber light is turned OFF, the green light is turned ON
and, a timer is started. Once X is "clicked" OFF the timer is stopped,
the elapsed time is displayed to standard-out and the system returns
to its initial state.  If X is "clicked" OFF before the green light
is turned ON then a "premature clicking" error message is written to
standard-out and the systems returns to its initial state.  If X is not
"clicked" OFF within 10 seconds of the green light being turned ON then a
"timeout" error message is written to standard-out and the system returns
to its initial state.

Notes:

The average human reaction time is 0.2 seconds.
