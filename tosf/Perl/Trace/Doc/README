trace.1 contains a trace of task FOO using EDF scheduling.  Note that
execution time (steps), deadline and period are all 10.

trace.2 contains a trace of task FOO using EDF scheduling.  Note that
execution time (steps) is 11 and, deadline and period are all 10. As
expected, the task misses its deadline.

trace.3 contains a trace of task FOO using RM scheduling.  Note that
execution time (steps), deadline and period are all 10.

trace.4 contains a trace of task FOO using RM scheduling.  Note that
execution time (steps) is 11 and, deadline and period are all 10. As
expected, the task misses its deadline.

To reproduce these traces, 
   - uncomment the print statements in Tosf::Executive/SCHEDULER.pm
   - in main.pl, modify the instance of FOO and the variable $schedulingAlgorithm
