Moore/Mealy Machine Translation
-------------------------------
A Moore/Mealy state-machine task has three major components viz,
a state table, an initial state and the actions associated with a
synchronous reset.

The tags below show the syntax used to capture these three components.

mmt_TableBegin 
mmt_TableRow(Current_State, Action(s), Next_State)
...
mmt_TableRow(Current_State, Action(s), Next_State)
mmt_TableEnd

mmt_Reset(Initial_State, Action(s))

Note 1: A file containing a Moore/Mealy state-machine task must have
extension .mmt and exist in the Fsm directory.

Note 2: The Reset tag is required even if there are no actions associated
with the task.
