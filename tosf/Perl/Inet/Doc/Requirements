Goal
====

  - Build a virtual packet-switching internet based on TCP/IP protocols
  - Protocols must be "approximately" RFC compliant
  - Favour ease of development over virtual network speed
  - Use serial lines and the real Internet to transport
    virtual packets
  - Virtual packet processing should be event driven where multiple
    virtual packets are processed by the stack at any give moment (as
    opposed to the model where a single virtual packet moves  from link
    layer to application layer (and visa versa) before the next virtual
    packet can be processed).


Preamble
========

inet is a virtual packet-switching internet based on TCP/IP protocols.
inet consists of
   - virtual network stacks called vstacks
   - virtual hubs called vhubs
   - virtual point-to-point connections called vp2p connections 
   - virtual LANs called VLANs
   - virtual WANs called VWANs.
  
A VLAN is constructed by interconnecting  two or more vstacks using
a vhub.  VLANs can be connected in a hierarchy using vhubs or can be
connected as a VWAN using vp2p connections.  inet is the collective name
given to multiple interacting vstacks configured into VLANs and VWANs.


Ports and Addresses
===================

IP address is a dot-decimal string containing 4 8-bit decimal numbers
   e.g.,  "192.168.18.21" (note, numbers may not contain leading 0s).
Host id. is a string  containing 1 8-bit decimal number e.g., "21".
Network id. is a dot-decimal string containing 3 8-bit decimal numbers
   e.g.,  "192.168.18".
IP broadcast address is "255.255.255.255".
Port address is an  integer string e.g., "23".
Mac address is an  integer string e.g., "7071".
Mac broadcast address is "0".

Note that Mac broadcasts are local to a VLAN and IP broadcasts
are never forwarded  by a router.

Packet Fields
=============

Valid values for a ethernet proto field are {"IP", "ARP"}.
Valid values for an ip  proto field are {"TCP", "UDP", "ICMP"}.
Valid values for an arp  opcode field are {"REQUEST", "REPLY"}.
Valid values for icmp type field  are {"ECHO", "ECHO_REPLY", "INFO_REPLY",
"TIME_EXCEEDED", "HOST_UNREACHABLE"}

Static MAC Assignments
======================

IP Address		MAC
------------		---
192.168.a.b		(a * 100) + b

ICMP SERVICES
=============
Name(port)		Payload In		Payload Out
----			----------		-----------
pingd(30)		(fload) time 		(float) time

UDP Services
============

Name(port)		Payload In		Payload Out
----			----------		-----------
incd(40)		(int) val		(int) incremented val

guessd(50)		(int) val		(string) guess result

Behaviour incd
--------------
if a client on "192.168.5.3" sends val==23 to incd at "192.168.5.51":"40",
then incd should return val==24 to the client.

Behaviour guessd
----------------
guessd manages a number guessing game.  Clients must register with the
server to play the game.  A client's first interaction with guessd is
viewed as registration and subsequently, the client is prompted to guess
a number between 1 and 100.

Any unsolicited guesses are dropped (with the exception of the
registration guess). 

The result of a guess is sent to all registered clients with an indication
of guess "goodness".

A val==0 guess indicates a client wants to leave the game.

New games are started with no registered clients.

Legacy Tools (deprecated)
=========================
hubSniffer.pl captures packets from a vhub port. It is
a simple host and may be used on a VLAN at any time.

hubServer.pl implements multiple vhubs.

p2pServer.pl implements  multiple vp2p connections.

vstack.pl implements one or more  inet tcp/ip stacks.

Packing and Framing
===================

Module		Packing/Collection Framing Tokens
------		---------------------------------
Ethernet.pm 	'_I_'
Udp.pm		'_J_'
Ip.pm		'_K_'
Arp.pm		'_L_'
Icmp.pm		'_M_'
Generic.pm	'_N_'
Line.pm		(user defines framing tokens)

Note, at a future date, user-data may be encoded as hex. strings to
ensure that user-data is not incorrectly interpreted as framing tokens.

Heartbeat
=========
Connection services  are based on TCP.  These connections are removed
by the Unix/Linux OS if the associated channel is idle for a prescribed
amount of time. To keep a channel open, a heartbeat packet is transmitted
along the channel periodically  The heartbeat is discarded once received.
